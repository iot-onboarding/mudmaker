## Reporting issues.

We would be very pleased to hear of issues relating to the code.  You
may report issues by opening a Github issue.

## Suggestions for new features

You may suggest new features, provided that you are unaware of any
intellectual property entanglements, and they can be added in accordance
with the license.

## Adding New Code

We gladly accept PRs for new code after some review.

## Changing Old Code

This is new code.  We expect that there will be a number of bugs.  We
welcome cleanup.

Generally speaking, a PR should be clear on what it intends.  File changes
should be limited to that intent.  Major changes will of course get more
attention.  It may be advisable to open an issue, to start discussion
prior to the PR.
